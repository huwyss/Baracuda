# Manta Chess Engine

A strong chess engine or at least it is supposed to beat me.

## Current Status

Manta Chess Engine is reasonably playing. However it does not beat me yet.

### Implemented features:
- Super simple GUI on console
- Minimax search performance allows for 3 or 4 half moves (4 takes about 10 seconds thinking time, 3 takes about a second)
- Evaluation of the current position via position for pawn, knight, bishop, ... Additionally pawn and knight get points for position on board and doulbe bishop gives extra points.

### Some important features that are missing:
- Standard GUI

### Features for a stronger game
- Opening book
- More efficient search, ie alpha beta

### Next Tasks
- Randomize if 2 or more moves have same score
- Better logger, ie log4net
